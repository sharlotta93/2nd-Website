# 2nd-website
This is my second attempt at creating a website from an online template.

Highlights of what I learned:

-Towards the second part of the website I am much better at using grid: there is a significant difference between class "infocards" and the later "fourth_part".
-I learned how to grade out the background image as well as set up the background image without using grid as I did in my first website.
-I learned how to add a button in fixed position that takes the user to the top of the page.
-I learned how to use icons which gave the website a lot cleaner and modern look.
-I added a subscription bar where the user can add their email address.
-I learned the importance of dividing the web page to body and footer

Things I wish to improve next time:

-continue on ensuring my code is maintainable and clean.
-learn how to name the classes to ensure the code is understandable to other.
-add JavaScript features
-add css hover to features
